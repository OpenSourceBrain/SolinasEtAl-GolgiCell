in cerebellar golgi cells: Simulations of their impact in

The cerebellar cortex input is profoundly influenced by the inhibitory
action of Golgi cells. Golgi cells display complex excitable
properties including (i) low-frequency pacemaking, (ii) adapting
high-frequency discharge during depolarization followed by AHP and
phase-reset, and (iii) sagging inward rectification during
hyperpolarization followed by rebound excitation (Forti et al.,
2006). An initial pharmacological analysis indicated that pacemaking
involved Ih, a persistent sodium current, an SK-type calcium-dependent
K+ current, and probably an M-like K+current. In order to assess
whether this set of currents was sufficient to explain pacemaking and
the other Golgi cell excitable properties, we have developed a
mathematical model. The above set of currents proved essential to
generate the salient Golgi cell responses. Moreover, the role of other
ion currents was predicted in order to obtain a proper quantitative
matching of specific properties. In particular, Ih maintained the cell
in the oscillatory regime, which was determined by the interplay of
INa-p with IK-slow and IK-AHP. Although IK-slow and IK-AHP are
redundant in the oscillatory process, IK-slow proved to be the most
effective for generating intrinsic resonance. Moreover, IK-A and
ICa-LVA are predicted to play an important role for regulating
response timing, and the ICa-VA/IK-Ca system to regulate spike
repolarization and high-frequency discharge. Our results suggest that
a complex complement of ionic mechanisms is needed to fine-tune
separate aspects of the neuronal response dynamics. Simulations also
suggest that the Golgi cell may exploit these mechanisms to obtain a
fine regulation of timing of incoming mossy fiber responses and
granular layer circuit oscillation and bursting.

Usage:

Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive.  Then
under:

----
MSWIN

run mknrndll, cd to the archive and make the nrnmech.dll.  Then double
click on the mosinit.hoc file.

----
MAC OS X

Drag and drop the Golgi_cell folder onto the mknrndll icon.  Drag and
drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

----
Linux/Unix

Change directory to the Golgi_cell folder. run nrnivmodl. Then type
nrngui mosinit.hoc
----

Once the simulation is running press Init & Run to generate a graph
similar to fig 2. from "Computational reconstruction of pacemaking and
intrinsic electroresponsiveness in cerebellar golgi cells":
